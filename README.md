    Dear Sir /BG Staff,

    Since this product works really fine, I want to share some open source Python3 software that works fine as a PC interface with these power supplies.  Communications works OK with a LINUX environment, should also work in a WINDOWS environment.  Those who are familiar with Python3 can easily change the source code in order to make anything else than a simple power supply (power regulation, slow sweep functions, PID regulation, logging of U,I and P during operation, remote control, ...).  Can this information be made public as my gratitude towards Banggood and Ruideng ?
